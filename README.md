# Hestia Booking - A fully featured MERN APP

https://booking.up.railway.app/

This is a clone of booking.com built using the MERN stack. Using ReactJS in the frontend, with ExpressJS for handling API requests, it runs on NodeJS, and use MongoDB as the database.

The intent of this app was for me to learn and implement how to connect a frontend to the backend, and to learn about relational databases. 

Find and book rooms at 3 major destinations (London, Cancun, and Dubai).
